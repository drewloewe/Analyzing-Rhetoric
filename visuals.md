# Rhetoric and Visuals

**Credit**: This section is adapted from the chapter on visual rhetoric in Atilla Hallsby's CC-BY-NC work *Reading Rhetorical Theory* cited in the References.

The first part of this section is about ‚Äúvisual culture‚Äù and adapts seven premises developed by Dr. Catherine Palczewski, John Fritch, and Richard Ice in their textbook, *Rhetoric in Civic Life*. The second section is about four distinct genres of visual rhetoric: iconic photographs, monumental rhetoric, body rhetoric, and image events.

## Visual Culture
In what ways is the contemporary world, particularly in the U.S., a visual culture? Visual cultures are scenes of shared public life where shared meaning is made using images, artwork, and memes. Although social media platforms have made visual representation and persuasion a common part of American public life, U.S. culture has a long history of commemoration, identification, and self-representation through visual imagery. There are at least seven different ways that a visual culture has manifested historically in the United States:

### 1) In a Visual Culture, Visual Rhetorics are Common and Change Forms

First, visuals and technologies of visualization have been around as long as verbal rhetorics, and change forms. Sometimes the images that define a culture shift in meaning over time and over different visual texts. The examples below each capture a similar signature 1950s aesthetic but also demonstrate how the feelings, values, and perspectives upon these aesthetics have shifted over time.

Compare and contrast how these two videos use a lot of the same forms but for different purposes:

* ‚èØÔ∏è [*The Stepford Wives* 2004 remake trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuAADocdVn0)

### 2) Visual and Verbal Rhetorics Work Together in Visual Culture
The second way that the contemporary United States is a visual culture is that visual and verbal rhetoric work in conjunction with one another. A number of experts from a various fields have said that there are significant differences between ‚Äúvisual‚Äù and ‚Äúverbal‚Äù culture. Some have also argued that we are moving away from a primarily ‚Äúverbal‚Äù (or literate) culture, defined by the circulation of information-as-words, and toward a ‚Äúvisual‚Äù culture in which we prize photographs and moving images as ways of digesting and retaining knowledge. The technologies available to us today make us multi-literate, rather than illiterate. For anyone who‚Äôs ever had to explain how to use the computer, TV remote, or phone to a relative ‚Äî or who have had to ask others for this kind of help ‚Äî it‚Äôs clear that the kind of "literacy" that more recent generations have isn‚Äôt less valid than the predominantly written cultures of the 20th century.

This new visual AND verbal literacy has generated its own languages; one example being the pictograms we use to communicate today. Emojis, for instance, allow us to easily communicate that we are ‚Äúrunning late‚Äù üèÉ‚è±Ô∏è, that it‚Äôs ‚Äúparty time‚Äù ü•≥ ‚è∞, or wish someone ‚Äúgood luck" üëç üçÄ.  But we can also imagine that these patterns of symbols would be mystifying for someone who was not always enculturated to know them.

### 3) Visual Culture Elevates Presentational Symbolism
Third, the contemporary U.S. is a visual culture because it elevates presentational symbolism. Presentational symbolism, according to the definition in *Rhetoric in Civic Life*, is ‚Äúa direct presentation of an individual object‚Äù that ‚Äúwidens our conception of rationality far beyond the traditional boundaries, yet never breaks faith with logic in the strictest sense.‚Äù

An example of presentational symbolism is the difference between attending a lecture virtually and attending it in person. The experience of a virtual and an in-person lecture is very different. Specifically, the style and feel of the presentation are different. Your experience of what counts as ‚Äúin-class‚Äù time is different. You either can control the experience of how you look by using camera covers or backgrounds or ‚Äì because you‚Äôre in a classroom with limited movement space, you don‚Äôt. Your experience of speech and persuasion is different depending on the presentational context. Your sensory experience, whether in a space with other people or by yourself, is also different.

Visual culture elevates presentational symbolism because it tries to simulate the face-to-face experience as a virtual experience. It tries to re-create face-to-face conversations (e.g. Zoom) or one-on-one debates (e.g., Reddit or Twitter (I refuse to call it X)) using technologies that allow us to symbolize our communication. Often, however, staging ‚Äúdebates‚Äù or ‚Äúface-to-face conversations‚Äù does not completely simulate the interpersonal experience. Other times, merely simulating debates results in further polarization or otherwise fails to live up to the argumentative ideal of idea testing or a true engagement with opposing ideas.

Presentational symbolism also ‚Äúproduce a simultaneous impression of many elements,‚Äù or a **gestalt**. Images multiply and proliferate. They also become increasingly complex, representing increasing magnitudes of data. An example of this kind of presentational symbolism is the graphic representation of populations, like this map below illustrates the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù of viral outbreaks in the United States as a presentation of reality that relies on a simultaneous impression of many elements.

### 4) Visual Culture is Where Rhetorical Reading Happens

Visual culture is the site of **dominant**, **negotiated**, and **oppositional** readings. These key terms describe how we interpret the visual rhetoric we encounter and create new visual rhetorics in response.


* The dominant reading is the preferred, taken-for-granted, hegemonic reading. In a dominant reading, the viewer takes the connoted meeting, and operates in the dominant code. Depicted below is the famous ‚ÄúFlag Raising on Iwo Jima.‚Äù It is also an example of an ‚Äúiconic photograph.‚Äù The most literal, hegemonic interpretation of the image is as a celebration of American teamwork in service of the shared goal of U.S. military victory. This is a dominant reading of this image. According to Palczewski et.al., ‚Äúby recognizing and accepting these connotations, we participate in a dominant reading, in which what this means for the United States culturally is accepted and goes unchallenged.‚Äù

  ![Iwo Jima flag image](https://open.lib.umn.edu/app/uploads/sites/280/2022/01/flag-raising-on-iwo-jima.png)

* A negotiated reading is where the viewer accepts some of the taken-for-granted meanings but recognizes exceptions. They understand what the image depicts, but challenge what it means. Depicted below is public artwork from Sydney, Australia that shows soldiers raising a McDonald‚Äôs sign rather than the flag. Like the original photograph, the image denotes a kind of military ‚Äúvictory,‚Äù but one that ultimately supports America as the land of capitalist corporations rather than as upholding civic virtue. The negotiated reading allows some of the photograph‚Äôs original meanings to be accepted ‚Äî the denotation of American victory ‚Äî while others are challenged ‚Äî replacing nationalistic camaraderie with connotations of commercialism.

* In an oppositional reading, the viewer subverts or challenges the basic ideas of an image circulating in public contexts. During the Iraq War, political cartoonist Billy Day drew a cartoon showing oil executives from Texaco, Exxon, Chevron, and Halliburton raising an oil derrick ‚Äî and gas prices ‚Äî under a banner reading ‚Äúmission accomplished‚Äù in an oppositional reading of the famous Iwo Jima image.

![Bill Day cartoon](https://shaymont.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/iwo-jima.jpg)

‚ÄúMission Accomplished‚Äù was a phrase visually featured in a speech by George W. Bush, who had declared victory in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003 while aboard an aircraft carrier. The cartoon is oppositional because it suggests that the U.S.'s motives for victory were financial rather than virtuous and that the ‚Äúvictory‚Äù that was sought might actually be reflected in harder times for Americans at the gas pumps. The oppositional reading, therefore, acknowledges the denotation (or ‚Äúvictory‚Äù) and the connotation (or ‚Äúvirtue‚Äù) by offering a rebuttal to the dominant reading on both fronts.

### 5) Visual Culture is a Stage for Presence
Fifth, visual images possess presence. Presence means that the image has an immediate impact on the viewer‚Äôs perception, or that it ‚Äúacts on us‚Äù by bringing something before our eyes. Presence is one reason why [prosecutors bring the alleged murder weapon into court](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=cd4f528d8c1c75a2&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1111US1111&sxsrf=ADLYWILN_ZlW6iVKeuGDQI8vZnLsWEzkvg:1721332663029&q=prosecutor+murder+weapon&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J5MIFhvnvU242yFxzEEp3BfblMs7eBu5zPnhtGsrETMyei1dUN8XCdtE6tzYkSMW5je6gJHMbu85xlRfdtmiGtbG_5-M7j0Qa2ukboExRfFBXPJvXYj-6FOuuyicdn8VQNezee_yFBwxH-q-TETjtBNEhwMYyJdEI_rgYSyXDFI4iuEtHg&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjR_K3vr7GHAxV3ke4BHe3wAPYQtKgLegQIDhAB&biw=1368&bih=677&dpr=1.25#vhid=wbKviKnbFuvQCM&vssid=mosaic). In visuals, presen

In visuals, presence can create a sense of "being there"; as Palczewski, et. al. put it, "Visuals may create virtual experiences in a particularly intense way, by making audience members feel as though they were present to witness an event. They offer a direct presentation instead of a discursive description. They can make things that are distant in time or space feel current and close," as in this recent example:

### 6) Visual Culture References Beliefs, Values, and Ideology
Sixth, visual images are points of common reference that illustrate and depict taken-for-granted beliefs, values, and ideologies of a culture. According to rhetorical scholars Victoria Gallagher and Ken Zagacki, visual images do the work of reflecting the culture that produced them. Some images, like the paintings of Norman Rockwell, have, in their words, ‚Äúevoke the common humanity of blacks and whites by making visible the abstract forms of civic life in the lived experience of individual citizens, both black and white.‚Äù According to Gallaher and Zagacki, Rockwell‚Äôs images did the work of reflecting American culture in three ways:

* Rockwell‚Äôs images disregarded established caricatures of Black Americans
* Rockwell‚Äôs images regarded its subjects as human individuals with unique narratives and identities.
* Rockwell‚Äôs images made abstract political concepts like ‚Äúequality‚Äù or ‚Äúfairness‚Äù knowable and concrete.

Let's examine two images of Rockwell paintings from Gallagher and Zagacki‚Äôs article using the above listed criteria. 

** "The Problem We All Live With"** 

The first image of the Rockwell painting titled ‚ÄúThe Problem We All Live With,‚Äù which depicts Ruby Bridges, the first Black child to desegregate Louisiana's all-white William Frantz Elementary School, on her way to her first class in 1960. The girl was escorted to school by four Federal marshals every day for a year and faced mobs screaming slurs at her and other harassment.

* First, Rockwell‚Äôs style of painting departed from typical ways that Black Americans were represented in editorial cartoons. Whereas a common way of representing diversity was in cartoons and using racist stereotypes, Rockwell painted Bridges and his other subjects as realistic characters in a three-dimensional space. His artwork sought to faithfully render events as they actually transpired in public settings without lampooning or satirizing the subject material. In ‚ÄúThe Problem We All Live With,‚Äù Rockwell places Bridges on a sidewalk, presumably on her way to school. In the background, the viewer can see the residue of a thrown tomato and a racist slur scrawled on the wall.
* Second, Rockwell recognized the particularity of his painted subjects: they tell a unique story and stand out from the other characters in the painting. Ruby Bridges is personalized in this image because she is the only figure who is fully within the frame of the picture. Her school materials make a striking contrast with the tomato and the slur, a reminder of the pro-segregationist protests that accompanied her attendance at the school.
* Finally, Rockwell‚Äôs image made abstract political concepts such as segregation and equality knowable. Ruby is depicted as ‚Äúon her way‚Äù to a desegregated education, while in reality she was still segregated within the school. Although Ruby represented the political battle over the desegregated classroom, Ruby was not ‚Äúfree‚Äù in her learning environment, contained by American racism, law enforcement escorts, and a community that was reluctant to accept her.

** "New Kids in the Neighborhood"** 

The second image is called ‚ÄúNew Kids in the Neighborhood,‚Äù which depicts a Black family moving into a white suburb.

![Rockwell's "New Kids in the Neighborhood", CC BY-NC-SA 2.0. Image by Peter E.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pmeimon/6200672880)

As with the previous painting, in ‚ÄúNew Kids in the Neighborhood,‚Äù Rockwell again disregarded racist caricatures of Black people by white artists. As noted earlier, his illustrations also depicted the standoffish relationships between Black and white residents at a time when the suburbs were still popularly depicted as populated by an exclusively white middle class.

Rockwell recognized characters in their particularity, this time through a juxtaposition of formal elements in the painting. The ‚Äúnew kids‚Äù are personalized based on their contrasting posture (standing straight and leaning forward/back). The color scheme on the left and right sides of the painting is also distinct. The ‚Äúnew neighbors‚Äù are dressed in pastels; they are holding a white cat and a baseball glove. The children to the white are drawn in a darker color scheme, one holding a black dog by a leash and another dressed as a baseball player. Gallagher and Zagacki state that the characters strike a ‚Äúvisual balance‚Äù and ‚Äúshow the things blacks and whites shared in common, despite racial and other differences."

‚ÄúNew Kids in the Neighborhood‚Äù made abstract political concepts knowable. Rockwell visually portrayed a gap between the two groups of children. The disproportion in the numbers of children on each side gives a form to abstract concepts such as equality and material realities, such as housing segregation.
