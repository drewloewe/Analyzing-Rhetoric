# 10. Rhetoric and Ideology
## What is Ideology? Isn't it Bad?
Maybe second only to rhetoric, ideology is a term that seems to have a) one meaning in common usage and b) another for people who study and analyze rhetoric.
In everyday uses of the term, ideology is often used as a shorthand for “prefabricated political agenda,” “hyperpartisan point of view,” “excuse for oppressive domination,” or something like “blinders that prevent you from seeing the truth.” People will often claim that they have the facts, but their adversaries have only ideology. (Notice how “ideology” seems only to be something one’s opponent is accused of being influenced by!). 

❓Pay attention to how the word "ideology" circulates in everyday contexts and see if you agree with the way that I have characterized its ordinary usage. Do you?

But, as we did with the term "rhetoric,: we are going to take a more specialized approach to the term ideology because we are interested in sharpening our ability to notice and make sense of communicative choices.

## A More Specialized Definition of Ideology from Linda Berger

Ideology has many definitions, most of which overlap in terms of ideas, but might diverge in terms of the words chosen to express those ideas. Various fields have their own specialized definitions of ideology, but we will explore some that are most applicable to our purposes as rhetorical analysts. In rhetorical studies, we conceptualize and define ideology as the commitments that unite and divide particular groups on the basis of powerful systems of beliefs, ideals, and values. One useful definition comes from law professor Linda Berger. She explains that "Ideologies are patterns or systems of beliefs, concepts, attitudes, values, and assumptions." Notice how Berger’s definition does not assume that ideology is per se oppressive, bad, or something that one's opponent uses for questionable ends.

Members of certain groups share these patterns or systems. Ideology is a group, shared point of view. There is no such thing as a one-person ideology. Groups create, use, and maintain ideologies “to understand the world” and form commitments to particular values. As Berger explains (relying on others she cites), ideology has three major functions within groups:

* **1) The “integrating” function**. That is, if members of a group have the same commitments and values, they tend to invest the same sets of ideas, symbols, and worldviews with a lot of meaning and evaluative power (e.g. good/bad, safe/risky, us/them, etc.). Sharing those commitments and values helps individuals and groups to craft their identities (“what we stand for”) and work together.
* **2) The “legitimizing” function**. That is, “by filling in gaps in our reasoning with the glue provided by shared networks” of beliefs and values, ideologies might “make the current state of things seem natural and inevitable.”
* **3) The “distorting” function**. (See Note) We are all familiar with the phenomenon we have observed in ourselves and others that one’s experiences, upbringing, previous work, etc. filter how we see the world. Indeed, how could they not? Often, the filtering function can be observed in the choice of terms and how those terms interact with one another, in what rhetorical theorist and critic Kenneth Burke called “terministic screens” that “select, reflect, and deflect” attention:
We must use terministic screens, since we can’t say anything without the use of terms; whatever terms we use, they necessarily constitute a corresponding kind of screen; and any such screen necessarily directs the attention to one field rather than another.

NOTE: Berger calls this a “distorting” function, but that word choice implies that there is some way for human beings to step out of the condition of being human beings who use language and symbols to understand and communicate. I would much prefer to call this function a “filtering” function because ideologies shape our views, and we are always situated within language, culture, and context. So we will amend Berger’s definition of this function for our purposes and call it the **“filtering” function**.

Ideologies create group cohesion and division. They enable and constrain possibilities through social power built in part by language and symbol use.
Ideologies are not static; they require continual circulation of communication to maintain, grow, evolve, and spread. What examples can you think of to show this continual circulation of communication to create group identity and cohesion? Ideologies are also not completely isolated or unitary; you probably belong to several communities with overlapping or sometimes opposed ideologies. 

❓What communities do you belong to? What similarities or differences do they have in “patterns or systems of beliefs, concepts, attitudes, values, and assumptions”?

**Specialized Term: Ideograph**

Rhetorical analysts who examine ideology use a specific enabling concept, the ideograph, to help focus their efforts. Rhetorical theorist Michael Calvin McGee defined the ideograph in a classic journal article in 1980. Ideographs, as McGee defined them, are "slogan-like terms signifying collective commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal." In other words, an ideograph is not a special term; it’s an everyday term that regular people would use, but ideographs are used in context as part of some group’s hierarchy of values. Examples of typical US ideographs are such words as freedom, liberty, security, religion, rights, property, and privacy or short phrases such as the melting pot, law and order, or the American Dream.

**PRO TIP**: When rhetorical analysts examine ideographs, they use a special but simple notation to show that they are treating these words and phrases as ideographs. The notation uses angle brackets: < >. So, to show that you are examining how "liberty" functions as an ideograph, you would mark it thus: <liberty>.
Ideographs are like the label on the outside of a box, for example, a box labeled <the American Dream>, <law and order>, or <freedom>. Inside that box are what particular groups call "the American Dream, "law and order," or "freedom," which might look different from another group's view, even though the two groups both use the same ordinary words as shorthand for all their particular histories, values, commitments, and purposes. For particular groups, what does it mean to be <free>, <secure>, or <self-reliant>? That all depends on community, context, history, and culture.

Ideographs can be defined and used in different ways by different audiences and groups. But ideographs are taken for granted in their context–they are shared and usually unquestioned in a group’s ideology. Their use throughout a given discourse or rhetorical artifact provides a powerful index to the worldview of that group as expressed in and exemplified by that artifact. Indeed, McGee calls ideographs “the basic structural elements, the building blocks, of ideology.” These building blocks are used by individuals in relation to groups, but persist and evolve beyond the contexts of single rhetors or single occasions. Ideographs operate individually and in clusters with other associated ideographs in a particular group's ongoing efforts to maintain collective commitment to values and purposes and to differentiate the particular group from other groups.

For example, a page on one American political party's website (The Green Party) declares the party's values by using this cluster of values, which operate as ideographs:

* Grassroots Democracy
* Social Justice And Equal Opportunity
* Ecological Wisdom
* Non-Violence
* Decentralization
* Community-Based Economics
* Feminism And Gender Equity
* Respect For Diversity
* Personal And Global Responsibility
* Future Focus And Sustainability
  
Another American political party (the Libertarian Party) declares its commitments to Personal Liberty, Economic Liberty, and Securing Liberty, with many specific ideographs under those larger ones, such as <privacy>,< adult rights and responsibilities>, <self-determination>, <marketplace freedom>, <freedom of adults to engage in (and purchase) sex work services>, <free trade and migration>, and many others.

On its website, St. Edward's University declares a collective commitment to Academic Excellence and Distinction; Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice; a Vibrant and Inclusive Campus; Austin Impact; and Infrastructure and Resources, which again circulate as ideographs.

❓Consider these terms and phrases as evidence of ideology’s filtering function/terministic screens. What kinds of values, commitments, identities, actions, and ways of living one’s life do these terms imply?

* Estate tax/death tax
* originalism; the living Constitution
* pro-choice/pro-life
* voting rights/voting integrity
* Holy Cross values
* The Quantified Life
* the American Dream
* diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice
* your golden years
* The Resistance
* security
* reform
* quality of life
* the unitary executive
* separation of powers
* hope and change
* #MAGA
* Black Lives Matter
* Blue Lives Matter
* All Lives Matter
* Whip Inflation Now
* Standard American English
* and many others . . .

Noticing ideographs and how they work individually and in connection with one another can help you understand and analyze how a particular group’s ideology is created and maintained by rhetoric. As Kelly Jensen explains, "A careful analysis of how ideographic clusters signify meaning through associating with other value terms can explain why ideologies circulate and adopt alternative meanings among various communities." 

## Specialized Term: Hegemony

One final concept will help you to learn about ideological rhetorical analysis: the concept of hegemony (heh-JEMM-uh-knee).

There are many definitions of hegemony with nuanced differences, but one of the best for our purposes comes from rhetoric scholar Dana Cloud. Cloud has defined hegemony as
the process by which a social order remains stable by generating consent to its parameters through the production and distribution of ideological texts that define social reality for the majority of the people.

In other words, hegemony operates at the level of the orthodox, default, taken-for-granted, "that's just the way things are" common sense (as in the shared assumptions and views about truth and values) in a particular culture. That common sense is reinforced via education; economics, commerce, and finance; media; religion; law; police and military; politics; aesthetics; and art.

❓What examples of "that's just the way things are" views can you name in current US culture? What are the terms by which ideas can be challenged? By whom? Under what conditions? How about in other countries?

Hegemony encompasses the constant need for broad consent to the prevailing view to be maintained (and to withstand challenges) by general consent, not by top-down force as the only means. Hegemony operates in part thorough material means or even force, but also through the circulation of rhetoric. Benedetto Fontana, a scholar of political philosophy, explains it this way:

>> [H]egemony describes the ways and methods by which consent is generated and organized, which, in turn, is directly related to the mechanisms and processes by which knowledge and beliefs are first, produced, and second, disseminated.

Fontana goes on to explain that ideologies are constantly coming in contact with differing ideologies. But "[t]he hegemonic conception is one that has become the "common sense" of the people. In this conflict between worldviews, "a counterconception (counter to the dominant ideology) is constantly generated, even if only embryonically, to challenge the prevailing common sense." Particularly flexible hegemonic ideologies can sometimes absorb, deflect, subvert, or co-opt competing conceptions rather than simply silence them through coercive power.

Noam Maggor, a scholar of American history, offers this pithy restatement of the concept of hegemony: "a worldview enshrined in the existing social order and shored up in public policy: in the tax system ..., in the legal system, in political institutions, and in actual practice." 

Depending on your interest, your artifact, and your goals as an analyst, it may be fruitful to use the concept of hegemony, both for what it can illuminate about the dominance of the powerful within a culture and the resistance of those who would seek to change or subvert the dominant taken-for-granted orthodoxy.
