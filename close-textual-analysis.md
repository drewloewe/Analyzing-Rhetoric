# Rhetoric and Close Textual Analysis

**Credit**: This section is heavily indebted to Kevin Stein's article ["Close Textual Analysis and the Link Between Theory and Rhetorical Artifact"](https://ujoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ujoc-stein.pdf) listed in the [References](references.md).

## What is Theory's Role?
It's probably not suprising—given the contested, contextual nature of rhetoric itself—that there has been a lot of debate about how rhetorical analysis is supposed to be done. To paraphrase an old joke about Jesuits, if you have two rhetorical analysts on an issue, you'll have four opinions. 

One debate is about **the role of rhetorical theory**: to what extent does theory determine, or even constrain, what the analyst argues? Is the theory a machine for generating insights? If so, does that make theory a mere cookie cutter that produces the same predictable results no matter what it's applied to? If so, yuck. 

What about the fact that **different analysts, with different theories, might produce different readings** of a particular artifact? Does that make rhetorical theory arbitrary? You say X because your theory predisposes you to, I say Y because my theory predisposes me to, and we both shrug because there is "no right answer"? If so, yuck again.

And, **even if an analyst really wants to work with an artifact itself without carrying the burdens or obligations of particular theories, how exactly are they supposed to do that?** It's this last debate that we'll focus on this section.

## The Two Michaels: the Leff vs. McGee Debate

Two influential rhetorical analysts, coincidentally both named Michael, exemplify this debate. Michael Leff argued that an overreliance on theory distracts the analyst from the artifact and therefore diminishes the potential insights that can be gained by doing analysis. Similarly, Michael McGee argued that the act of analysis should be what creates various theories, rather than analyses being applications of particular theories. In other words, Leff and McGee promote methods of close textual reading to develop insights from the artifact and its context rather from applying preexisting theoretical ideas. Leff sums it up this way:

>>While the critic must frame the discourse within its context, the focus of attention [should] center[] on the text itself and the rhetorical features embedded within it. Working from the evidence within the text, the critic proceeds to make inferences about what the work is designed to do, how it is designed to do it, and how well that design functions to structure and transmit meanings within the realm of public experience.

So both Leff and McGee want to focus primarily on the artifact and don't want to use theory to pigeonhole or process artifacts in a mechanistic or predetermined way. But they diverge in a few ways.

Leff argued that it was possible to draw reasonably stable boundaries around a rhetorical artifact, such as a famous political speech, such that an analyst could work primarily with the text of the speech itself and pay relatively less attention to elaborating context or the effects the speech had. Leff did not argue that context was irrelevant, but wanted analysts to focus mostly on the artifact itself. 

McGee, on the other hand, saw rhetoric more expansively and woven into the creation and circulation of ideology, beliefs, and attitudes in a society. For McGee, individual texts are not discrete units of analysis but are "fragments of 'information' that constitute our context." So McGee emphasized that analysts should pay more attention to cultural contexts because "the elements of context are so important to the text that one cannot discover or even discuss the meaning of text without reference to them.”

Kevin Stein sums up this debate thus:

>>These attitudes regarding the boundaries of discourse and the importance of rhetorical context help to explain the specific approaches offered by Leff and McGee. Leff wants to understand how rhetoric functions to create meaning. McGee wants to examine the product in order to understand the specific social and historical processes that constituted it. This process/product distinction is at the heart of the chasm that separates Leff from McGee.

So both Michaels wanted to break away from theory as being deterministic or dictating what the analyst should do and both wanted to focus on what the artifact was doing instead of "applying" off-the-shelf sets of concepts. But they took slightly different paths, leaving us with the question of *what an analyst doing a close textual reading should actually do*.

## One Way to Do a Close Textual Reading

Stein offers an approach that he argues is productive and that blends insights from the Leff and McGee approaches, while avoiding possible pitfalls. Stein argues that "Rhetoricians should not be trained in broad theoretical structures that can be used to analyze texts. They should become masters of rhetorical processes." So Stein suggests that an analyst pay attention to the following:

### 1. Delineate the Context

Stein seems to argue that the analyst can pay some attention to context, and should, but also has the power to responsibly delineate where enough context has been established and keep the focus primarily on the artifact itself. Make a judgment call.

### 2. Delineate the Boundaries of the Artifact

Stein agrees with Leff that one can reasonably delineate a particular artifact for analysis even while that artifact of course does not arise from, or go into, a vacuum free from other artifacts. He argues that rhetorical analysis would not be possible without this sort of line-drawing. Again, make a judgment call.

### 3. Recognize that You Can Never Escape Presuppositions, but Build Your Case

Stein argues that while one can analyze an artifact without fully using a particular theoretical framework, any act of reading entails presuppositions on the analyst's part. What does the analyst notice? Why does that stand out? What case can they make about the artifact and, as always, **so what?** Stein puts it this way:

>>All researchers, including rhetorical critics, select their objects of study based on which questions interest them. If they randomly selected research questions in order to avoid these biases, there would be no such thing as a program of study and there would be a great many bored scholars. Apart from my assumption regarding the text’s worthiness, I also assume that the context is significant, that the text will yield something interesting, and that a close systematic examination of the features is the appropriate method of analysis.

## Example of Close Textual Analysis

To illustrate what he suggests, Stein offers a close reading of one paragraph of [The Unabomber Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Society_and_Its_Future) in his article. His analysis begins on p. 9 of the [article](https://ujoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ujoc-stein.pdf), which is the sixth page in the online PDF. **Read that analysis**. Stein makes a case informed by rhetorical theory, but not predetermined by it, and he primarily focuses on the text itself.
