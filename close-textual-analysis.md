# Rhetoric and Close Textual Analysis
## What is Theory's Role?
It's probably not suprising—given the contested, contextual nature of rhetoric itself—that there has been a lot of debate about how rhetorical analysis is supposed to be done. To paraphrase an old joke about Jesuits, if you have two rhetorical analysts on an issue, you'll have four opinions. 

One debate is about **the role of rhetorical theory**: to what extent does theory determine, or even constrain, what the analyst argues? Is the theory a machine for generating insights? If so, does that make theory a mere cookie cutter that produces the same predictable results no matter what it's applied to? If so, yuck.

What about the fact that **different analysts, with different theories, might produce different readings** of a particular artifact? Does that make rhetorical theory arbitrary? You say X because your theory predisposes you to, I say Y because my theory predisposes me to, and we both shrug because there is "no right answer"? If so, yuck again.

And, **even if an analyst really wants to work with an artifact itself without carrying the burdens or obligations of particular theories, how exactly are they supposed to do that?** It's this last debate that we'll focus on this section.

## The Leff vs. McGee Debate

Two influential rhetorical analysts, coincidentally both named Michael, exemplify this debate. Michael Leff argued that an overreliance on theory distracts the analyst from the artifact and therefore diminishes the potential insights that can be gained by doing analysis. Similarly, Michael McGee argued that the act of analysis should be what creates various theories, rather than analyses being applications of particular theories. Both Leff and McGee are therefore more "bottom-up" (working from particulars to develop generalities) than "top-down" (using generalities to illuminate particulars) analysts. In other words, Leff and McGee promote methods of close textual reading to develop insights from the artifact and its context rather from applying preexisting theoretical ideas.
