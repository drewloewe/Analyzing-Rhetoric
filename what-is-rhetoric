# What is Rhetoric, Anyway?

## Everyday Definitions of Rhetoric

The first thing to understand is how the word *rhetoric* is used in courses such as this is different from how that same word is used in everyday language. In everyday uses of the word, rhetoric is a synonym for something like political spin, demagoguery, propaganda, bullshit, bombast, figures of speech, surface-level style, sales pitches, exaggeration, and other types of communication. The binary opposition underlying everyday uses of the term rhetoric is rhetoric vs. substance, with rhetoric as the inferior member of that particular pairing. Pay attention to how the word circulates in everyday contexts and see if you agree with the way I have characterized its ordinary usage.
