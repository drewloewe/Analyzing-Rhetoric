# What is Rhetoric, Anyway?

## Everyday Definitions of Rhetoric
The first thing to understand is how the word *rhetoric* is used in courses such as this is different from how that same word is used in everyday language. In everyday uses of the word, rhetoric is a synonym for something like political spin, demagoguery, propaganda, bullshit, bombast, figures of speech, surface-level style, sales pitches, exaggeration, and other types of communication. The binary opposition underlying everyday uses of the term rhetoric is rhetoric vs. substance, with rhetoric as the inferior member of that particular pairing. Pay attention to how the word circulates in everyday contexts and see if you agree with the way I have characterized its ordinary usage.


## Specialized Definitions of Rhetoric
People who study and analyze rhetoric use the term more broadly, encompassing more communicative situations than the (usually) negative ones that the common use of rhetoric assumes. In fact, it seems that are as many definitions of rhetoric as there are rhetorical theorists and teachers in courses such as this one. Here is a small sample from among many competing definitions, some old, others much more recent:

Rhetoric is….
* the ability, in each particular case, to see the available means of persuasion—Aristotle
* the study of misunderstandings and their remedies—I.A. Richards 
* the use of words by human agents to form attitudes or to induce actions in other human agents—Kenneth Burke
* the function of adjusting ideas to people and people to ideas—Donald C. Bryant
* the energy inherent in emotion and thought, transmitted through a system of signs, including language, to others to influence their decisions or actions—George Kennedy
* the art of linguistically or symbolically creating salience. After salience is created, the situation must be translated into meaning.—Richard Vatz
* a form of reasoning about probabilities, based on assumptions people share as members of a community. —Erika Lindemann
* the whole range of arts not only of persuasion but also of producing or reducing misunderstanding.—Wayne Booth
* a craftwork for exercising humanity—Emmanuelle Danblon
* strategic use of symbol systems using various modes of communication—language, still and moving images, and sound.—Lisa Blankenship
* where reasonable disagreement may exist and persist indefinitely...rhetoric is a social practice that helps us choose.—Christian Kock
