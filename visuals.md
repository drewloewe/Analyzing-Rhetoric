# Rhetoric and Visuals

**Credit**: This section is adapted from the chapter on visual rhetoric in Atilla Hallsby's CC-BY-NC work *Reading Rhetorical Theory* cited in the References.

The first part of this section is about “visual culture” and adapts seven premises developed by Dr. Catherine Palczewski, John Fritch, and Richard Ice in their textbook, *Rhetoric in Civic Life*. The second section is about four distinct genres of visual rhetoric: iconic photographs, monumental rhetoric, body rhetoric, and image events.

## Visual Culture
In what ways is the contemporary world, particularly in the U.S., a visual culture? Visual cultures are scenes of shared public life where shared meaning is made using images, artwork, and memes. Although social media platforms have made visual representation and persuasion a common part of American public life, U.S. culture has a long history of commemoration, identification, and self-representation through visual imagery. There are at least seven different ways that a visual culture has manifested historically in the United States:

### 1) In a Visual Culture, Visual Rhetorics are Common and Change Forms

First, visuals and technologies of visualization have been around as long as verbal rhetorics, and change forms. Sometimes the images that define a culture shift in meaning over time and over different visual texts. The examples below each capture a similar signature 1950s aesthetic but also demonstrate how the feelings, values, and perspectives upon these aesthetics have shifted over time.

Compare and contrast how these two videos use a lot of the same forms but for different purposes:

### 2) Visual and Verbal Rhetorics Work Together in Visual Culture
The second way that the contemporary United States is a visual culture is that visual and verbal rhetoric work in conjunction with one another. A number of experts from a various fields have said that there are significant differences between “visual” and “verbal” culture. Some have also argued that we are moving away from a primarily “verbal” (or literate) culture, defined by the circulation of information-as-words, and toward a “visual” culture in which we prize photographs and moving images as ways of digesting and retaining knowledge. The technologies available to us today make us multi-literate, rather than illiterate. For anyone who’s ever had to explain how to use the computer, TV remote, or phone to a relative — or who have had to ask others for this kind of help — it’s clear that the kind of "literacy" that more recent generations have isn’t less valid than the predominantly written cultures of the 20th century.

This new visual AND verbal literacy has generated its own languages; one example being the pictograms we use to communicate today. Emojis, for instance, allow us to easily communicate that we are “running late” 🏃⏱️, that it’s “party time” 🥳 ⏰, or wish someone “good luck" 👍 🍀.  But we can also imagine that these patterns of symbols would be mystifying for someone who was not always enculturated to know them.

### 3) Visual Culture Elevates Presentational Symbolism
Third, the contemporary U.S. is a visual culture because it elevates presentational symbolism. Presentational symbolism, according to the definition in *Rhetoric in Civic Life*, is “a direct presentation of an individual object” that “widens our conception of rationality far beyond the traditional boundaries, yet never breaks faith with logic in the strictest sense.”

An example of presentational symbolism is the difference between attending a lecture virtually and attending it in person. The experience of a virtual and an in-person lecture is very different. Specifically, the style and feel of the presentation are different. Your experience of what counts as “in-class” time is different. You either can control the experience of how you look by using camera covers or backgrounds or – because you’re in a classroom with limited movement space, you don’t. Your experience of speech and persuasion is different depending on the presentational context. Your sensory experience, whether in a space with other people or by yourself, is also different.

Visual culture elevates presentational symbolism because it tries to simulate the face-to-face experience as a virtual experience. It tries to re-create face-to-face conversations (e.g. Zoom) or one-on-one debates (e.g., Reddit or Twitter (I refuse to call it X)) using technologies that allow us to symbolize our communication. Often, however, staging “debates” or “face-to-face conversations” does not completely simulate the interpersonal experience. Other times, merely simulating debates results in further polarization or otherwise fails to live up to the argumentative ideal of idea testing or a true engagement with opposing ideas.

Presentational symbolism also “produce a simultaneous impression of many elements,” or a **gestalt**. Images multiply and proliferate. They also become increasingly complex, representing increasing magnitudes of data. An example of this kind of presentational symbolism is the graphic representation of populations, like this map below illustrates the “big picture” of viral outbreaks in the United States as a presentation of reality that relies on a simultaneous impression of many elements.
