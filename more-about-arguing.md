# More About Arguing
## Claim and Support
You’ve already learned a little about the way that our course asks you to understand your own activities in arguing—that is, not as quarreling, fighting, or merely disagreeing reflexively as a partisan such as talking-head guests on cable TV infotainment shows do. While such squabbling with words falls under the broad heading of rhetoric (and thus could be something you examine in a project), here we are going to understand arguing as a process of making claims connected to support for those claims.

You sometimes hear people say, “I would argue that….” and then make a claim. For example, someone might say, “I would argue that LeBron James is the greatest NBA player of all time.” Or “I would argue that this policy, despite intentions, actually makes inflation worse.” Often, no support is offered, though presumably, it could be offered if you ask a simple question: “Why?” When someone asks “Why?” or “What makes you say that?” or a similar question, they are indicating that they resist (or do not yet see) the connection between the claim and the support for the claim. In arguing, the rhetor is asking their audience to go on a journey, a movement from where the audience is right now to where the rhetor invites them to be. In the first example above, the rhetor is saying “Come join me over here, where we accept that LeBron James is the greatest NBA player of all time.” In the second example, the rhetor is saying “Come join me over here, where we accept that this policy worsens inflation.” So unless the audience already accepts the claim and the support for the claim, the rhetor will likely have to give support for it. Support is what makes the journey from where the audience is now to where the arguer is inviting them to be possible.

What support might be offered for the claim that LeBron James is the greatest NBA player of all time? Notice that what we call “support” might shift. What seems to count the most? The number of championships won by teams he has been a part of? His contributions to other teammates’ success? The overall win-loss record of teams when he is in the game? His salary and endorsements? His philanthropy? You can see that, pretty quickly, you might have to deal with the preliminary issue of the criteria for “greatness” and maybe refine the term to something more concrete and mutually understandable as constituting support. But presumably you and the arguer could come to an understanding of what kinds of support might make a journey from where you are now over to where the arguer is inviting you to be: statistics, percentages, strength of schedule, etc.
What support might be offered for the claim that a particular policy, despite the intentions of its proponents, actually makes inflation worse, not better? Again, you might have to settle on how and when “worsening” occurs, and by how much (and for whom), but it should not be too difficult to see that you and the arguer might agree on what could support their claim: economic data, similar policies in the past, expert conclusions, and so on. So support is evidence, data, analysis, or accepted authorities that make the journey over from where the audience is now over to where the arguer is inviting them to be more or less reliable. 

Support answers the Why? It serves the because . . . function. *LeBron James is the greatest NBA player of all time because . . .* *This policy, despite intentions, will worsen inflation because . . .*.

## STAR Questions (Sufficiency, Typicality, Accuracy, and Relevance)
Because support is the basis for the audience possibly moving over to join the rhetor in their acceptance of the claim, the quality, quantity, and relevance of the support is crucial. Think of support as the bridge that could take the audience from where they are now over to join the rhetor. If a bridge has too little material, or the material is rotten or defective, or it’s the wrong kind of material (would you walk across a bridge made of marshmallows?), problems arise. One way to figure out whether a claim is supported (and how well it is supported) is to ask the STAR questions. STAR is a shorthand mnemonic device that helps you remember four sets of ideas: Sufficiency, Typicality, Accuracy, and Relevance, which this resource borrows from Richard Fulkerson's explanation.

Ask these questions:

### Questions about Sufficiency-S
* How much support is offered for this claim?
* Is this the kind of claim that might require a lot of support?
* How carefully is the claim stated; does it match the quantity of support offered or go far beyond it?
### Questions about Typicality-T
* Is this the type of support that typically connects to such claims or is it the wrong kind of support for this purpose?
* Is it a non-representative, extreme example?
### Questions about Accuracy-A
* Is this the best, most direct support?
* Is this support as current as it needs to be?
* Does this support appear to have errors?
### Questions About Relevance-R
* Does the support actually support this particular claim? Does it support a claim that is “kind of” like this one, but not really this claim?
* These questions will help you to understand and analyze arguments: yours, mine, your classmates’, anyone’s.

## Enthymemes
Arguments function with claims and support, and you can ask the STAR questions about the connection between claims and support. You will be expected, in your work in this class, to craft explicit, clear, well-supported arguments. All that is well and good, but you know from having lived your life so far that people often do not give explicit support for their claims, yet audiences often accept them. Some of the most powerful and effective arguments seem to rely on an assumption that the audience will fill in the missing support on its own.
This phenomenon is nothing new. Aristotle noticed it back in ancient times, and came up with a term for it, the enthymeme (pronounced EN-thuh-meme). According to a translation by scholar George Kennedy, in Ancient Greek, enthymeme meant “something held in the mind,” with the audience holding the “missing” support for claims in its mind. Thus, depending on context, the rhetor does not necessarily have to offer explicit support for some (or any) of their claims. Instead, the rhetor might rely on the audience to participate in co-creating meaning by filling in the gaps from a common well of accepted support.
Every meme, and much humor, relies on the audience supplying the unstated connections. Can you think of examples of memes and jokes that work as enthymemes, with the audience filling in the unstated part? Enthymemes are at the heart of rhetoric. As Rita Copeland, a scholar of classical studies and literature, explains it,

>> The word “enthymeme”… comes from the word thymos, meaning heart, mind, spirit, desire or soul as manifested through the passions. It signifies the seat of emotions and intuitions, where inferences, judgments, and intentions are made. As the key device of persuasion, the enthymeme is a kind of junction box between emotion and deliberation.

Because rhetorical analysts are especially interested in how rhetors and audiences share meaning, you should always look out for what is taken for granted in any communication.
If claims do not have explicit stated support, what does the rhetor seem to be taking for granted that their audience will already accept or fill in on their own? A clear sense of what is taken for granted is a powerful tool for understanding communication. It also underscores the need for you to understand communication in context—you will have to figure out, by research, what seems to be taken for granted by the rhetor and audience. Surfacing the implicit, unspoken ideas in communication and working through their implications is central to effective rhetorical analysis. Indeed, rhetoric scholar Krista Ratcliffe, to whom I'll give the last word here, argues that the enthymeme is crucial to understand because it is

>> a rhetorical tactic with the potential to help people construct their own arguments and analyze arguments directed to them by detecting the unstated. Once such dark matter and energy are detected, we can determine if the detected assumptions reasons, and claims need to be celebrated or challenged.
