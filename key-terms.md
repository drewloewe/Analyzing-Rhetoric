# 3. Key Terms 

## Rhetor

The rhetor is the face of the particular communicative effort—the speaker, writer, or producer. In some cases, it's easy to see who the rhetor is. When you try to persuade a friend or family member to take some action or change to their mind, you're the rhetor. When I argue that learning to analyze rhetoric is important, I am the rhetor addressing an audience of students. Sometimes, though, we have what might be called an imputed rhetor. If a politician gives a speech in favor of legislation, audiences impute the communication to the politician, even if the speech was written in whole or in part by a speechwriter. Ad agencies prepare ads for corporations, but the public imputes the message—and responsibility for the choices that the message demonstrates—to the corporation. The university’s president communicates as the voice of the university on policy and priorities; what she says is imputed to the university as a whole. Rhetoric embraces how the rhetor (the speaker, the company, the influencer, the government, the writer, the protestor, etc.) in a particular context attempted to design communication (using words or other means) to prompt audiences to do, think, feel, or believe something—to adhere to some idea.

## Primary Rhetorical Artifact, Secondary Evidence
In this course, you will select and analyze primary rhetorical artifacts; that is, the primary evidence of a particular rhetor’s effort to reach an audience in a particular context. So, for example, if you want to analyze a speech by the President urging Congress to enact a particular bit of legislation, you might choose to analyze a video of the speech, a transcript of the speech, or the two together as the evidence of the President’s efforts to get the legislation enacted. Even if, say, the video of the President’s speech appears on YouTube, in this example, you would not be analyzing YouTube itself with all of its ads, comments, and other material. Nor would you analyze, say, a newspaper article that reports about the President’s speech because the reporting would not be the best evidence of the speech.

But the reporting might be useful as secondary evidence to establish the background and context for the speech. Secondary evidence is essential for establishing background and context and can include reporting, previous posts or tweets, scholarly sources, web pages, “about us” information, government data, and many other sources.
Remember: rhetoric never comes out of a vacuum or goes into one: context always shapes and constrains the rhetor’s efforts.

To analyze a primary rhetorical artifact, you must set it in its context. You will have a lot of freedom to choose primary rhetorical artifacts that you are most interested in, as well as guidance. But the most important point to remember upfront is that you need to decide whose rhetorical efforts you are analyzing. If, say, the leader of the opposition party made a speech in response to the President’s speech from our earlier example and urged that Congress not enact that legislation, the opposition’s speech would be secondary evidence of how the President’s speech was received. But if you wanted to analyze the opposition’s speech, then that speech would be your primary rhetorical artifact and the President’s speech would become secondary evidence that establishes the background and context for the opposition’s speech.
Whose rhetoric are you interested in analyzing and what is the primary rhetorical artifact that best shows it? Notice how shifting the focus of your interest shifts what counts as the primary rhetorical artifact.

## Stasis: a Way to Zero In on Issues
Have you ever participated in or witnessed an argument where the participants seemed to “talk past each other” or to not even agree about was at issue? Have you ever struggled to come up with ideas, especially when asked to work with other peoples’ texts? Of course you have. People have been experiencing those same phenomena as long as humans have been using language. 

Ancient rhetoricians developed a simple yet powerful system for understanding what is, or could be, at issue in a particular situation. They called this system stasis (STAH-sis). Stasis is a system for identifying and zeroing in on issues and for understanding, focusing, or creating an argument. 

Various systems have been formulated over the centuries and updated or contextualized for different situations. Rather than try to adopt X or Y system that has been offered over the years, I want you to think of stasis as a useful system for coming up with ideas, understanding them, and for avoiding misunderstandings. In this course, here are the ideas that you need to know about stasis:

Stasis is a range of possibilities for inventing claims and focusing an argument.

If a writer and audience are going to have a meaningful, relevant exchange (an explanation, an argument, or something else), they should first be on the same page about what the issue is and how to explain or argue about it. You have no doubt heard and used the sayings "we’re not on the same page" or "comparing apples to oranges" before. Those common sayings are expressions of the idea that there was no basic agreement yet on what the issue was or how to argue about it.

Stasis is best thought of as a system of asking questions across a spectrum from foundational to complex. It can help you to understand arguments and where misunderstandings arise. 

The writer and audience must agree, at least provisionally, on the foundational issues before moving to the complex levels. 
For example, if you want to argue that the government should develop defenses against UFOs, you have to first establish that UFOs exist and that they are a threat. Otherwise, the policy argument of what to do about UFOs is not relevant.

Shifting from the more foundational stases to the more complex stases shifts perspectives and possibilities. 
Misunderstandings often arise when a writer (or speaker) and audience shift from one stasis to another abruptly. 

### The Stasis Spectrum
* Existence (most foundational)
* Definition
* Cause and Effect
* Worth
* Comparison
* Policy or Procedure (most complex)

The spectrum runs from the most foundational stasis (existence) to the most complex (policy).

| Most foundational | | | | | Most complex |
|-------------------|---|---|---|---|-------------|
| **Existence Stasis** | **Definition Stasis** | **Cause/Effect Stasis** | **Worth Stasis** | **Comparison Stasis** | **Policy or Procedure Stasis** |
| What core facts can we agree about regarding the existence of the issue or phenomenon? | How should we name or define the issue or phenomenon? | What brought about this issue or phenomenon? Where did it come from? | Is this issue or phenomenon good, bad, or mixed? | What can be learned by comparing this issue or phenomenon with another? | What should be done to address this issue or phenomenon? Why is that the thing to do? How is doing that feasible? How will we know whether it was effective? |
| To what extent are we arguing from common understandings of reality? | What are the implications of labeling it one way or another? | What are the effects or implications of this issue or phenomenon? | How do we determine that? | What is the worth of this issue or phenomenon compared to another? | Who has authority or ability to come up with and implement policy? Are there proper steps that need to be followed? |
| | | | | How can we better understand this issue or phenomenon by examining another? | |
