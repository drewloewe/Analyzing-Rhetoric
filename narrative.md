# Rhetoric and Narrative

**Credit**: This section is adapted from the chapter on rhetoric and narrative in Atilla Hallsby's *Reading Rhetorical Theory* cited in the [References](references.md).

This section discusses the relationship between rhetoric and narrative. The first part of this section introduces key concepts related to narrative, including the inside/outside of narratives, form, genre, and narrative frame theory. The second section of the chapter addresses Walter Fisher’s influential narrative paradigm and the concepts of narrative coherence and narrative fidelity. 

## Form, Genre, and Frame Theory

Narratives have many different components that make them rhetorically relevant. They are reflections of an audience’s values: a story is never just a story. They are about the people telling them, about ways of envisioning the future, or about the contemporary problems that those tellers are confronted with.

Narratives are ways of shaping public memory or retelling events that have happened in the past. They allow us to remember what has happened or to retell these moments as alternate futures. They organize how we interpret public events that we encounter in our everyday lives. Many people have tried to make sense of the Covid-19 pandemic by watching films such as ▶️ [Outbreak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5povsMKfT4) or ▶️ [Contagion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sYSyuuLk5g). Narratives also reflect a dominant ideology because they reflect the values not just of the people who create them but of the people who read and watch them, making them a part of their lives.

### Inside and Outside
Narratives have an inside and an outside, and some specialized terms capture those ideas. The inside is the **diegesis**, and the outside is the **extra-diegesis**. In a written narrative, the elements that occur in the timeline of the story form the diegesis. Things that happen in the story but fall outside the scope of the story’s events are extra-diegetic. 

For instance, a story may be about characters whose lives were changed by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The things that happen to these characters would be part of the diegesis. But if September 11, 2001 were not explicitly a part of the story, they would be extra-diegetic if those events occurred before the story ever began. In films, diegetic and non-diegesic sound define what is available "inside" and "outside" of the story. For instance, if a character turns on a radio in a film and the sounds are audible to both the characters and the audience, then that sound is diegetic. If ominous music plays and is only audible to the audience but not to the characters on screen, then that sound is extra-diegetic. 

▶️ **Example**: See how the film [*Jaws* uses diegetic and non-diegetic sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_4hOY-9nKA).
