# Rhetoric and Narrative

**Credit**: This section is adapted from the chapter on rhetoric and narrative in Atilla Hallsby's *Reading Rhetorical Theory* cited in the [References](references.md).

This section discusses the relationship between rhetoric and narrative. The first part of this section introduces key concepts related to narrative, including the inside/outside of narratives, form, genre, and narrative frame theory. The second section of the chapter addresses Walter Fisher‚Äôs influential narrative paradigm and the concepts of narrative coherence and narrative fidelity. 

## Form, Genre, and Frame Theory

Narratives have many different components that make them rhetorically relevant. They are reflections of an audience‚Äôs values: a story is never just a story. They are about the people telling them, about ways of envisioning the future, or about the contemporary problems that those tellers are confronted with.

Narratives are ways of shaping public memory or retelling events that have happened in the past. They allow us to remember what has happened or to retell these moments as alternate futures. They organize how we interpret public events that we encounter in our everyday lives. Many people have tried to make sense of the Covid-19 pandemic by watching films such as ‚èØÔ∏è [Outbreak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5povsMKfT4) or ‚èØÔ∏è [Contagion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sYSyuuLk5g). Narratives also reflect a dominant ideology because they reflect the values not just of the people who create them but of the people who read and watch them, making them a part of their lives.

### Inside and Outside
Narratives have an inside and an outside, and some specialized terms capture those ideas. The inside is the **diegesis**, and the outside is the **extra-diegesis**. In a written narrative, the elements that occur in the timeline of the story form the diegesis. Things that happen in the story but fall outside the scope of the story‚Äôs events are extra-diegetic. 

For instance, a story may be about characters whose lives were changed by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The things that happen to these characters would be part of the diegesis. But if September 11, 2001 were not explicitly a part of the story, they would be extra-diegetic if those events occurred before the story ever began. In films, diegetic and non-diegesic sound define what is available "inside" and "outside" of the story. For instance, if a character turns on a radio in a film and the sounds are audible to both the characters and the audience, then that sound is diegetic. If ominous music plays and is only audible to the audience but not to the characters on screen, then that sound is extra-diegetic.

### Narrative Time, Fabula, Syuzhet

* **Narrative Time** describes the way that stories are ordered for a reader, listener, or viewer. Sometimes, a story isn't told linearly. Narratives may begin *in medias res*, where events are already happening or have already happened. Stories both happen step-by-step and as an overall "arc" that connects the beginning to the end. They can happen as brief moments of surprise and as the unfolding of deeply plotted events.
* **Fabula** describes the chronological sequence of the events in a narrative. The fabula is the timeline that we would construct if we were to untangle all of the events in the narrative, creating a timeline that puts them back in their linear order from beginning to end, though the narrative may not have presented them in that order.
* **Syuzhet** (pronounced, roughly, "siuu-ZHJET") is the way a story is organized, or its structure. In other words, if the events in the narrative occur in first, second, third order, then that is the syuzhet. If the narrative begins in the middle, returns us to the past, and takes us to the end, then that is the syuzhet. If the narrative is a collection of different stories that start and end at overlapping times, then that is the syuzhet. It is time in the narrative voice of the story as it is told.

Here are some explanations that will make these concepts easier to understand:

## Formal and Generic Elements of Narrative

Narratives are also categorized and reshaped by genre or conventions that allow stories to be widely recognizable and appreciated by wide audiences. Genres create a pattern of expectation, such that some of the best stories make us question our expectations of what the characters will do or make us jump with a twist ending. Both ‚Äúform‚Äù and ‚Äúgenre‚Äù refer to ways of organizing narrative. So, what is the difference?

Form and genre are two important ways of describing the recognizable organization of narratives. According to the description provided here, forms are the particular logical elements that may occur within a given narrative, while genres are arrangements of those elements as recognizable kinds of narrative.

Forms are akin to the building blocks of narrative. They are durable, repeatable elements that may appear as features within many different narratives. Form arrange symbols and organize language in ways that give it a recognizable and repeatable order, like a figure of speech. 

* ‚èØÔ∏è [See how the musical form of ‚Äúthe four-chord song‚Äù uses a similar sequence of notes, played at a variety of tempos, to create a range of different songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I).
* ‚èØÔ∏è [The Cinematography of Horror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMKtCT21UvU)
  
Forms can be picked up and then used in a variety of different contexts, creating the same meaning using different messages. For example, the ‚Äúdistracted boyfriend meme‚Äù may be understood as a form when we witness the same elements in a similar arrangement within a different image or text. This meme has a precursor from *The Killers*, a film from 1946:

![Still from *The Killers* and Distracted Boyfriend meme](https://x.com/sociolinguista/status/1725731722845647290)


When we recognize the similarities between these images, we can see how a similar meaning occurs in very different messages whose creation is separated by several decades. In a nutshell: form is a way to create the same meaning across different messages.




 or creating different meanings using the same messages.

By themselves, forms are ambivalent concerning the ethical or political goals that they serve. Studying form alone cannot tell us which forms are correct or better or worse. They serve a number of different purposes. When analzying forms, we have to pay attention to where and how those forms are being used. The following video offers an excellent example of forms and how they may be picked up, repeated, and recur in many different texts.
